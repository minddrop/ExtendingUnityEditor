# UnityEditorExtension

This is my favorite extensions for development supports in Unity Editor. This includes:

- Toggle Inspector Lock: toggle inspector lock mode. (`Alt+I`)
- Clear Logs: clear unity editor console logs. (`Alt+C`)
- Restart Editor: restart unity editor with the version and project you are using at that time. (`Alt+R`)
- Script Template: insert root namespace automatically.
